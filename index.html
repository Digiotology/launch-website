            <p>Digiotology and Nimbus Ninety consistently bring together the right mix of people and facilitate meaningful connections and collaboration, whether at our esteemed advisory board breakfasts, summits or dinners. Audiences are always carefully crafted to provide the best mix of perspectives, to inspire lively discussion and debate. Suppliers are all experts and their input to discussions carefully vetted. The Digiotology network expands beyond traditional senior business stakeholders to include the new vanguard of the digital age; the programmers, designers, data scientists, the technologists and innovators who are at the coalface of innovation projects.</p>

          <li id="voice">
            <p>Market research has been at the heart of the Nimbus Ninety community for over 10 years and this trusted market voice is reflected in the content of our member-driven activities and reports. Central to our research offering is the Digital Benchmarking Survey which has been designed to help executives measure, compare and fast-track their digital transformation initiatives and assess whether they have the right capabilities for success. Digiotology adheres to the same rigorous research principles and endeavours to become the market voice for the new digital vanguard of programmers, data scientists, designers and innovators. Our team’s extensive knowledge and experience has led to the development of the Digiotology innovation methodology, a unique customised design methodology, developed in partnership with our network.</p>

          <li id="xp">
            <p>Our team has extensive innovation and transformation experience across blue chip organisations, SME and the Public Sector. Through our unique methodology, independent research and consultative approach, we help business and technology leaders, and their teams renew and reinvent their business models to enable growth and competitive advantage. It’s hard for us to bring to life a Digiotology experience in words; our clients have described our work as ‘mind blowing’, ‘imagination stretching’, ‘awe inspiring’ and ‘an explosion of ideas, opportunities and possibilities’. And we can be trusted to deliver this kind of experience thanks to our team of business thought leaders, and highly trained researchers, programmers, data scientists, designers and innovators. Work with us and you’ll find well-practised processes and a meticulous eye for detail that only comes from years of experience.</p>

            <h2>Explore</h2>
            <h3>Discover a future of infinite possibilities </h3>
            <p>The first stage in the journey is understanding what you need and how we can work together to help you achieve your innovation and transformation aspirations. In most cases we’ll start by spending some time helping you to refine, frame and prioritise what it is you want to do. It’ll be important to get a handle of what data you have and how it could be properly leveraged so we might run a full audit of your data as a starting point. We’ll want to deep dive into your world to make sure we really understand what’s achievable and discover what changes in the organisation might need to occur to enable success. We’ve found the Nimbus Ninety digital benchmarking survey is a really useful tool to help us to do just that.</p>

            <h2>Plan</h2>
            <h3>Your glimpse of the possible</h3>
            <p>Once we’ve fully understood your aspirations and assessed your resources and capabilities, we’ll prepare a bespoke plan defining what’s achievable. We’ll also give you some feedback on the organisational changes we think you’ll need to make to really optimise the potential of the project. And should you choose to engage with us to help you through your transformation project, you’ll find we also have the skills and expertise to help you build the strategy, capabilities, skills and culture. This will be your first glimpse of the possible, and we’ll be able to share some relevant client case studies with you so you can see how similar initiatives have worked in other organisations we’ve helped.  </p>

            <h3>Let’s get to work</h3>
            <p>The build is when it all starts getting exciting as this is where your ideas come alive. It’s an iterative process and it's when we roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty. This is what we do best; reaching out to our extensive network of data scientists, programmers and designers, and developing ideas and plans into prototypes, APIs, workshops and solutions. It’s a pretty inspiring part of the process and everyone starts to get very excited about the possibilities. </p>

            <p>Now’s the time to be brave and just give it a go. It’s a bold step, but daring to try and encouraging ‘heroic failure’ in your teams is actually seen by experts as the best competitive advantage and it’s how things are done in start-ups where this mentality is hardwired into their DNA. Changing your organisation’s culture can’t be done overnight, but we can guide you through changes that will have a powerful and lasting impact on your ability to bring your ideas to life.</p>

            <p>This is when we’ll introduce a prototype, like a 3D version of your vision, to the market. It’s not going to be perfect and that’s ok because we’ll be able to test, learn and refine as we go, and in a live environment. Depending on your skill sets, resources and capabilities, we’ll either enable and complement your teams to do this themselves, or build capacity and do more as you require.</p>

            <p>Now’s the time to regroup to gather, review and evaluate data and feedback from your prototype launch and decide on further refinements to hone product and processes. We’ll want to collaborate closely on your next steps for implementation and, should you choose to do so, can partner with you to help you take your prototype to a full market launch.</p>
