				Research, experimentation and evidence are the cornerstones upon which modern medicine is being built. Research generates important benefits for both individual patients and populations through improving our understanding of health and wellbeing and the complex factors that lead to disease.

				Such research depends on access to both individual and population level data, and sharing complex datasets from sequencing, databanks and repositories, quality-assurance efforts, public health measures and patient-generated data.

				Our data science platform redefines what’s possible in research analytics for biomedical and life science research, providing a secure online environment to pool, interrogate, analyse, and transform these datasets into actionable information in support of knowledge transfer from clinical research to clinical practice.

				**We adopt the best architecture practice from data-rich, consumer-grade companies such as internet businesses in terms of performance, open source and open standards, and has added the concepts of collaboration, information governance, infrastructure independence and an information commons approach to build a consumer-grade biomedical informatics platform.**

					li#collaboration.active
						p Our data science platform has been designed to ensure that team members can easily discuss, share, modify and create analysis in a single, secure online location. The ‘owner’ of a project is given access to a private workspace configured with compute, storage and analytical tools, and can invite collaborators to join the project and define the data sharing and information governance models for the particular project or study. The newly formed team have embedded social media tools within the platform to post and share updates, comments and insights.
					li#analysis
						p An embedded R web console gives access to a vast array of cutting edge, open source, statistical and machine-learning analysis packages that enable you to quickly construct and customise advanced analytical workflows across complex and varied data types, and support the whole process from data preparation, to visualisation, analysis, and reporting through to publication.
					li#standards
						p From a compute and storage perspective, the emphasis is on open source and international standards (Linux, Centos, VMware for virtualisation, ITIL Capacity and Availability Management processes) and at the database, analytics and application layers on open standards and open source technologies (Postgress, SQL, Madlib, R). Wrapped around this has been the development of ETL, Data Sharing, Auditing and Collaboration functions for health and biomedical markets.
					li#secure
						p Our platform is built to the ISO27001 information security management model, and undergoes regular penetration testing by independent security consultants using the PCI 	Security Standards Toolkit (credit card payments) as a benchmark. By definition, the system is a collaborative environment, but role-based access ensures that users only have access to specific databases and other resources through partitioned workspace environments for separate research groups.
